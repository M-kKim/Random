inetd
The role of the inetd daemon is to act as a “superserver” for other network server processes, for example telnet and ftp.  
Rather than have all the network processes running in memory all the time, inetd listens for incoming connections and starts the necessary service when one is received.

===================

at
The at service is like cron, however the command is executed at the given time, but is not repeated.

Linux Logs

Lastlog 
Tracks user logins.
Lastlog formats and prints the contents of the /var/log/lastlog.


============================


Last
Reports the last login of users.
Last searches the /var/log/wtmp and shows a list of all users logged in and out since the wtmp file was created.

===============================


Many Linux systems are configured to maintain a command history for each user account.
These are the locations they might be found:
~/.bash_history
~/.history
~/.sh_history
~/.*_history

================================

Connections to systems made using SSH to and from a compromised system result in entries being made in files for each user account:
∼/.ssh/authorized_keys, and 
∼/.ssh/known_keys.
These entries can reveal the hostname or IP address of the remote hosts.


===========================

Apache is a commonly found open source web server application.
http Logs – httpd stores its logs in /var/log/httpd/apache in two different files.
Access_log – This stores general access information:
Who, when, how and what actions they undertook.            
The second file is error_log which stores access and other errors.

==============================

MySQL is a commonly used open source relational database system.
User accounts may have a ∼/.mysql_history file that contains queries executed using MySQL.

==============================

Bash history: contains commands executed in the bash shell. it often recorded historical executions without timestamps. 
The bash history file for a user is located in his home folder ~/.bashrc and in /root/.bashrc for the root account. 
Hence, it is important to examine the bash histories of both users and root.

Execution with Sudo: is necessary when the execution requires root privilege. 
All executions with Sudo are recorded in auth.log.

=============================


/var/log/auth.log
This log contains all authentication events and Cron job session events (e.g. start, close etc.) for Debian. 
This may be the most important log to analyse.

/var/log/deamon.log
Records events generated by background daemons. 
Usually, background processes/services offer invaluable logs to a user’s activities.

/var/log/syslog
Contains general system messages. 
Particularly, it also contains cron job execution with its associated commands.

/var/log/btmp
This stores failed login attempts.

/var/log/wtmp
Stores all logins to the system

====================================

The sysctl configuration file can be used to change the configuration of the kernel at start up.
This file can control the drivers that are loaded by the kernel at start up as well as the configuration of the kernel itself.
The sysctl file may be found in a number of different locations and may have a different name. It may be found here:
/etc/sysctl.d/*.conf
/run/sysctl.d/*.conf
/usr/local/lib/sysctl.d/*.conf
/usr/lib/sysctl.d/*.conf
/lib/sysctl.d/*.conf
/etc/sysctl.conf

========================

The Phalanx2 rootkit is launched from a separate startup script under the /etc/rc.d/ directory with the same randomly generated name as the hidden directory where the rootkit components are stored.
Kernel modules are commonly used as rootkit components to malware packages. 
Kernel modules are loaded when the system boots up based on the configuration information in:
/lib/modules/ and /etc/modprobe.d directories, and 
/etc/modprobe or /etc/modprobe.conf file. 
These areas above should be inspected for anomalous entries.
There are several configuration files that Linux uses to automatically launch an executable when a user logs into the system that may contain anomalous entries in a compromised system. 
Items in the /etc/profile.d directory and the /etc/profile and /etc/bash.bashrc files are executed when any user account logs in and may be of interest.
In addition, each user account has individual configuration files (∼/.bashrc, ∼/.bash_profile and ∼/.config/autostart) that can contain entries to execute software when a specific user account logs into the system.

=============================

It is common for an attacker to entrench themselves as a new, unauthorised service.    The initialisation startup script /etc/inittab calls other scripts such as rc.sysinit and various startup scripts under the /etc/rc.d/ directory, or /etc/rc.boot/ in some older versions.
